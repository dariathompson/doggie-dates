You will need to sign up to MongoDB and create a cluster.

Click on connect when viewing your cluster and a model should pop up with 3 options. click on "Connect your application" to see your MongoURI.

You will need to create an environment variable.

1. Create a .env file in the root of the project
2. Create an Envrionment called ATLAS_URI with your MongoURI - Like this: ATLAS_URI="[ENTER_YOUR_MONGOURI_HERE]"


## Running the application

To run the Server and application at the same time:

```
$ npm run dev
```

and That's it! Now feel free to play around with the application on localhost 3000.

## Planning

This was a pair project completed by Two Makers Academy Graduates:

- [Daria Thompson](https://github.com/dariathompson)
- [Patrick Oliver](https://github.com/poliver24)

The aim of this project was to work together to build our skills on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), and to further out proficiency in React and Redux. 
Both being newcomers to MongoDB and NoSQL we saw this as the perfect opportunity to cover some knowledge gaps on some of widely used technology. 

It helps that we also both love Dogs!
